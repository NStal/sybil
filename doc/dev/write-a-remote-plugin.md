# What's remote plugin?

A remote plugin no more than an external program who use the sybil web interface API. Sybil web interface APIs are provided using a websocket based RPC protocal.

# What for?

You can mark you favorite fun-art archive in sybil as `read later` or any other `custom list`. You can open a timed job to scan your `custom list` every night to automatically download the fun-art medias to your subscribe folder.

You can read through you twitter list in sybil and mark some interesting tweets into retweet list and using the remote plugin to do auto retweets.

You can write a remote plugin to listen to new archive and filter certain keywords to notify you using hubot or gmail.

The idea of sybil is that every piece of information you collect can be made use of.
